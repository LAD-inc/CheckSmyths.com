				CheckSmyths is a website that can check current stock level for a product in all stores on Toys.ie.<br />
				<br />
				It is particularly useful for bargain hunters has it can quickly tell you if there is any stock of an item in the country!<br />
				<br />
				CheckSmyths is not affiliated with Smyths in anyway.<br />
				<br />
				Please note for data purposes the website keeps a record of what item was searched for and what time the search was made,<br />
				in future this may be used for a "most searched for" section. There is no other information that product number and a time stamp<br /> 
				(time and date) recorded. Please contact me if you feel this is a problem.<br />
